# SizeOfChickens

I came across a tweet stating _"The size of chickens you are eating has increased 364% in size over the last 50 years. Here is what this means for your health."_.

You can notice that the data they give says something else: there is not +364% between 1957 and 2005. Then, the question was: maybe he applyed a model on the data to estimante the size in 1972 and in 2022 to obtain that percentuage increase. I tried to do that and the results are reported in this markdown assuming the data they provide is verified.

CONCLUSION

Before scaring people about health issues you should be sure about the informations you have.
